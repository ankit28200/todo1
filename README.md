TO-DO list application using Node.js in the back-end and any JS based front-end framework. The application is expected to have the following features

List all tasks
Add a new task
Edit/Update an existing task
Delete a task
Copy a task

These operations should be handled using APIs. Implementing authentication/authorization of users is not required. The front-end should be a simple/clean page showing all the tasks. There should be an option to add/delete/edit tasks. The operations are expected to be integrated with the frontend.
